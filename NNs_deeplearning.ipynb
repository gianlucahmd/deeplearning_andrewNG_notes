    "### What is a Neural Network? (NN)\n",
    "Let’s consider the housing price prediction problem: we want to predict the price of a house given its size. We may fit a straight line, but we also want the price of the house to never be negative. To avoid this, let’s bend the curve so that it becomes horizontal once it reaches zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of this a small neural network with a single neuron, that given the price outputs either zero or a value based on the line’s slope and the house size. In the neural networks literature, this is called a *Re*ctified *L*inear *U*nit, or *ReLU* .\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume we know more things about the house, for instance number of bedrooms, postal code, wealth of the country, etc. Each of these things would imply other informations (like size of the family that can fit in, walkability, school quality in the neighbourhood, etc.). Those factors, then, influence the price. What we’re describing is a neural networks that takes certain features (size, n of bedrooms, etc), and can combine them into more abstract features (we can think of them as the walkability, school quality, etc that we talked about before) in order to better predict the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/house_prediction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This nodes that placed between the input features and the output are called _hidden nodes_, and since each of them is connected to every input feature the NN is called _fully connected_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning\n",
    "The most value in DL is in *Supervised Learning* applications: you have an input X, and you want to predict the output Y. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/supervised_learning.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Different types of Neural Networks are used for different kinds of input data. For instance for Real Estate and Online Advertising standard NNs work well, while for photo tagging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the best, for sequence data Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used instead. For more complicated situations custom implementations are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/NNtypes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Learning has been used both with _Structured Data_ (classic RMBS database for instance) and with _Unstructured Data_, like text, audio and images, where each feature (for instance a pixel in an image) doesn’t have a precise meaning by itself. DL greatly improved our capabilities of mailing sense of Unstructured Data. Those application made more “noise” in the media, but the economic implications of DL has been great on both uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Deep Learning taking off?\n",
    "The traditional learning algorithms (SVMs, logistic regression, etc.) have performances often plateau with increasing amount of data. In recent times with the digitalisation of the society we’re starting to have massive amounts of data. With scale, bigger NNs start performing significantly better. Therefore, **scale** is what is driving deep learning progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/deep_learning_scale.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With small training sets, the performances of the system are often driven by the skill of the person training the dataset in training the hyperparameters, engineering features, choosing the algorithm and so on. With very large datasets, Deep NNs are the best option compared to the aforementioned strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modern rise of DL, the first approach was to scale data and computational power. In the last years, the focus switched on improving the algorithms instead. For instance, a breakthrough was to switch from sigmoid activation functions to ReLUs, that avoid having very small gradients at the extremes of the function and therefore very slow learning. This approach therefore greatly speeded up computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is very important also because the approach for creating new ML applications is iterative: you start from an idea, code it, experiment, and iterate. With slow computation, this cycle is very slow, while faster computation allowed to iterate much faster and test more ideas."

    "### Binary classification:\n",
    "In binary classification the goal is, given an input, predict to which of two classes this input belongs to. For instance, given the picture of a cat we want to classify it between cat (1) or not cat (0). In this case, if we have an RGB image which is 64 pixels by 64, we can represent it as a $64*64*3 = 12288 $ vector (3 because of the three channels R, G, and B for red, green and blue). We’ll use $n_x$ to indicate the number of features of the input (in this case 12288).\n",

    "\n",
    "We need to compute the error of our model. Traditionally, the most used loss function would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(\\widehat{y}, y) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\widehat{y} - y)^2 $$\n",

    "1. $y=1$: in this case the loss becomes simply $-\\log \\widehat{y} $. Since we want the loss function to be small, then we want $\\widehat{y}$ to be very large.\n",

    "The cost function is convex: we can find its global minimum. What Gradient Descent does is, initialising w and b from all zeros or from random values, starts from this initial value for J and makes step in the direction of the biggest gradient (steepest direction in the curve), until converging to the global optimum (or close by).\n",

    "The gradient’s meaning is the slope of the curve. Therefore assuming that we’re starting from the right side of the curve in the next picture, its gradient it’s going to be positive (slope > 0), therefore the gradient descent  step is going to move our point in the opposite direction of the slope, which is towards the center, where the minimum is. The same applies if we start with a J that is in the left side of the curve (slope < 0 -> step in the opposite direction, towards the center).\n",
    "\n",

If we take a point with a coordinate 2, its value on the vertical axis is going to be $f(2) = 3*2 = 6$ If we move a little further on the right, let’s say to $a = 2*0.001$, we’ll have a value of $f(2 * 0.001) = 6*003$. The slope of the function is the ratio between the height and the width we moved, so in this case $0.003/0.001 = 3$. If we take $a = 5$, $(f(a) = 15)$ and calculate the value for $a = 5 * 0.001$, we’ll get the same thing: $f(5*0.001) = 15*003$. The slope is the same in this case\n",

    "If $a = 2.001$, then $f(a) \\approx 4*004$. This means that the derivative of $f$ at $a=2$ is $4$, which means that every step we do horizontally is going to cause a variation vertically 4 times higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take $a = 5$, $f(a) = 25$. If $a = 5*0.001$, $f(a)\\approx 25*0.01$. Therefore, the derivative of f at $a=5$ is 10. In this case, the derivative of the function is 2a.\n",

For this reason, when we update the weights the matrix of the weights will always be all equals to each other, and they’re all be computing the same thing.

The value of 0.01 is OK for small NNs, we’ll see later how to change it for deep NNs.\n",
